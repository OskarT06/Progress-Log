I have to try to figure out how to make it so that the placeables turn red when they can't be placed and they are prevented from being placed when they are red. I borrowed the same code I put in the building system, but it worked the opposite way for some reason. I showed Zack and he found what was wrong. The code that I was writing was on the detection area for the placeables, but I was telling the area to modulate itself instead of telling it to modulate the placeable. Zack changed some code around, and now the placeables turn red when they can't be placed. I saw a few bugs when Zack was testing it, but he told me not to worry about fixing them because they will be fixed elsewhere. I went back to the Taiga to see if there were any other placeables that I could make it so you can actually place them in game. All of the placeables I found where either already made, or Zack told me not to worry about them because they are either going to be updated, or made differently.
