Since there are only a few days left of the program, I took today as sort of a relax day and I will most likely continue working on enemies tomorrow. Aiden and I started looking at the other games that have been submitted, and started testing them to see what they were like, how they worked, and if we found any bugs to let the teams know about. We found one bug in Slipdrift City, which we recorded a video of and posted it in the discord so they could see how it happened, what happened, and try to figure out how they could change it if they wanted to.
