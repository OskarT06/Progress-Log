Today is my last day, so I have to make sure that if anyone needs to make something, I have to get it done today. I started working on the last few enemies that I had to get finished. I made the frog, and Zack said that he also wants me to make the wasp, bear, and turtle. The wasp will be set up the same as the other flying enemies, so that won't be too tough. The bear and turtle however do not work the same as the other enemies. I finished the wasp and started on the bear. I had to add some new code since the bear sleeps until you enter it's detection area, then it wakes up and chases you. The turtle is similar so I just took the same code from the bear and put it into the turtle.
