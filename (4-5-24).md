Zack wants me to make a scene in between when you enter the tent for the first time and before it actually puts you in the tent making it clear that the character wants to go camping and is coming here by choice. He said to use the code from the notes, so that the text slowly writes itself on the screen with just a black background. Zack showed me what I was doing wrong since I didn't realize I had set the visibility ratio. He put in some simple text, and I went through and made it fit more with the tone of the game.
