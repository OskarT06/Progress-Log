I added a couple more comments to the building code if someone wants to find out how it works but doesn't know what the functions and variables do. I went back to my build of the game to see if I found any new bugs in the game or if I can narrow down what causes the bugs that we have also found. I didn't find any new bugs and some of the problems I had might just be because I am not fully up to date with a branch that has everything working on it. Hiro finished all the stuff with picking up blueprints and tool crafting so I can pull from his branch once he pushes, make a new build, and then start testing things out. For some reason, I am fully up to date with Hiro's branch, but when I make a new build, none of his new code is in the build. I am not sure what the problem is, but Hiro is busy helping Ian with the hand enemy so I'll ask him once he is done.
