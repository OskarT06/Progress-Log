I have to ask Hiro how he has the building menu set up so I can try to make it so that when you left click when the wall is red, the building menu is not re-opened until you left click and the wall is green. I asked Hiro how the building menu opens, and he came over to show me how it works. We then started adding new code, I told him how some of the code worked, we commented the code, and ultimately made it more stable.
