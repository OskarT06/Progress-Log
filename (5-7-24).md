I went back to my snake enemy scene, and I found that since I copy and pasted the nodes from the normal enemy scene into the snake scene, adjusting them in the snake scene would make the same changes to them in the normal enemy scene. This was an easy fix since all I had to do was delete the copied nodes, and just create all of the same ones in the scene again. Once I remade the nodes, I went through and names them the same things that they are named in the normal shadow enemy scene, created the collision shapes, connected signals, and assigned export nodes. Thomas found a few problems with the walking animations, where for some reason, some of the frames were changed out with the incorrect ones. I went through and fixed the walking animations for the ground, but the walking animations in water still have to be updated to the newer walking animations. I asked Zack if there were any other enemies he wanted me to make, and he said no because everything is breaking so he would rather fix the things that are broken before making anything new.
