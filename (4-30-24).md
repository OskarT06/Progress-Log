I finished up working on my Post-Mortem. Aiden, Davian, Ian, Zack, and I have been talking about ways we could remake some sound effects to make them work better with the game sounds such as the swinging, walking, walking in water, flying, the bear trap, and the hand emerging and submerging in water. Aiden has been redoing the player animations recently, and came over and asked me to take the new walking sprite sheet, replace the old walking with the new walking, adjust the frames per second so that the player doesn't look like they're walking really fast or really slow, and then show Aiden so he can see how it looks to finish the rest of the walking animations. Once I got the animation finished, I showed Aiden how fast I had the animations. I changed them to 4 frames per second to make the player walk slower since 5, which is the default, made it look strange and 8 made it too fast. Aiden and I talked about a way that we could make it more obvious which of the character's legs is in front and which is in the back. He tried making the leg in the back darker but for some reason the player looks like it is dragging it's leg behind it. I tried to help Aiden come up with a way to make the walking animations look better, but I'm not an artist so I don't know the techniques to accomplish what Aiden is trying to do.
