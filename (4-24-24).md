Now that Aiden is here, I can change the cursors once he finishes them. It was very easy to change the cursors since I already had code changing it, I just had to put in the correct mouse cursor file. I found a bug where since the walls can be destroyed whether the hammer is equipped or not, it prevents the door from being opened because the button to open the door is the same as the button to break the wall. I tried to add something to the chat line scene and script to make it so that it will say what button to press when you can destroy a wall, but Hiro made the scene and he is working on something else so it might take me a little while to figure out what each thing does. I told Hiro what I needed to add to his scenes so he could explain how they worked. While he showed me how his worked, I showed him how mine worked, and we were able to make it so that the walls can only be destroyed with the hammer when destruction mode is entered from the building menu, a destroyed walls refunds the materials that were used to build it, and just fine tuned the entire base building system so it works much better than it did before.
