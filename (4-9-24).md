Ian and I went outside to record sound effects from his car to use for the car in our tutorial. Once we got the sounds, we came back in, and I airdropped them to my gamedev station and put them into the project. Zack pointed out that they were m4a files and not mp3 and said that we can't use m4a files, so I took them to a converter, changed them over to mp3 files, and then put them back in the place of the m4a versions of the files. I asked Zack when I could start adding the special thanks section of the credits, and he said that I can pull from his branch and then start adding to it. He also wanted me to make a new section in the credits and showed me what I had to do to make the credits work the same with the longer sections.
