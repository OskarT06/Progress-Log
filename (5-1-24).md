Aiden is finishing the new player animations, so once he is done, I can remake them. Aiden finished the attack down and asked me to put it into the player scene, go to the game map, and show him what it looks like in the game. He found a couple things that he didn't like with how the player moves when it attacks and went back to change them. It is taking Aiden a little while to get the animations done, but he told me that he wants to make 3 different idle animations. I already know how to shuffle things so they are random, so I told him he can make as many idle animations as he wants since making them randomized is really easy.
