I started looking at tutorials to learn different skills that I would need. The first turtorial I looked up was how to make a simple donut in blender. I focused on that for a little while until I realized that learning to code was probably more important. I then looked up a tutorial for unreal engine, and began my process of trail and error to try and learn the main components. I started slowly working my way through the engine to learn the basic mechanics to get a gist of what was going on and where I had to go to find certain things that I would need to use.
