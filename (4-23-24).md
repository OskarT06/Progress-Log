Aiden didn't get the other building cursors done because he was trying to solve some problems on his computer, so I can't implement the other cursors into the building scene. Zack said that one of them is done and in the files, so I just have to figure out how to set the cursor. I looked back over the older scripts to figure out how to change the cursor, and found it after a few tries. I now have to figure out how to make it so that the walls can be destroyed when they are clicked on. I was able to make it so that the wall is set to invisible when the player right clicks on the wall, but the area and collision were still there. I solved this problem by making it so that the wall removes the children of the areaness and staticness so that when the wall is right clicked on, it deletes the area and collision so you can place something in where the area was before and can walk through where it used to be. The only issue it that you can delete the wall while holding any tool and not only when the hammer is equipped. I took the enumerator and the variable from Hiro's player script defining what tool was equipped and put it into my building script so I could make it so that you can only break the wall when the hammer is equipped. Once I added this code however, it made it so that the walls can't be broken at all. Hiro said that I have to grab the tools from the player one more time before the if statement asks what tool is equipped. I couldn't figure out how to make it work, so I just pushed all of the working code to the base building branch so anyone can change it if they want.
