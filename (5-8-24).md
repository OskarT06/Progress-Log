Zack said that I should still wait to make any new enemies since he is fixing a lot of issues and doesn't want to start working on anything new yet. I told him to just let me know when he wants me to make a new enemy, and which one he wants me to make. Until then, I played some more of our game to see if I could find any other bugs. I found a few, but when I told Zack what the bugs were, he said that he already knew what the bug existed. Since we already have the standard enemy and done and then two more enemies that are biome specific, only spawning in the plains and the marsh, I went in and made two more enemies, one for the mountains and one for the forest. I started working on the goat enemy, and Zack told me that he also wants me to make the vulture and bat once I am done with the goat. I finished the goat and the bat, with a few things that had to be different for each other. The goat and the standard enemy were pretty much the same, the goat just had a different type of animation. The standing animations for the bat and the vulture had to be gotten rid of since something that flies can't just stop moving it's wings and continure staying in the air. Zack also said to put the bat and vulture collisions on a different layer so that they don't fly over everything, but still fly over some things. Of course, if any of these changes are not what Zack wants, he can change them when he puts the enemies into the game.
