Now that the building system is done, I don't really know what to work on since most of the other things we have to do are either already being worked on, or can only be worked on once something else is finished that isn't done yet. Testing the building system in the build of the game I made will require Hiro to be finished with tool crafting and actually being able to use the tools properly once you get them which he hasn't finished yet. I will have to find something to do until he is finished, so I'll just follow along with some more C# tutorials since I haven't done any in a while. The tutorials that I have already done have a built in code compilier so you can work along with the tutorial, but all of the ones after that require a separate code compiler which I don't know where I can write C# code other than an older version of godot, but that also requires quite a few other installations. I asked Zack if there was anything he wanted me to do, and he reminded me that the rotating for the corners stopped working. I went back and fixed it which wasn't hard since the rotating code for the corners was almost the same as the rotating code for the wall and side wall which was still there. Zack wants me to change something with the building menu so that there is only a wall, door, and corner, and you make the other walls by rotating the wall and corner. He also wants it so that text comes up with the building menu showing how to place, cancel, and rotate. I don't fully know how the building menu works, so he told me to ask Hiro how I would do what he wants me to. Zack showed me how to make it so that the controls for building will come up when a wall is selected, follow the wall around, and then disappear when the wall is placed.
