I started working on a way to make it so that the walls can be destroyed after they are placed. I asked Aiden if I could get some new cursors for when you are building, and then I started making new areas for after the walls are placed so that the walls turn red when the mouse enters the shape so the wall can be destroyed. I made the new areas for them, so now I have to add the instantiating in the script. I lloked to see if there was a problem with the areas because they weren't coming up, but I found that it was because since I was copying the collision shape and then adjusting it to cover the entire wall, it was also changing the wall collision. I had to make more code to add the destruction areas as a child of the area so that it actually brought the destruction areas in. I tried to make it so that when the mouse enters the destruction area, the wall turns red. I showed Zack my progress and explained my idea to him, and he started adding things since he had an idea of how to make my idea work. We ran into a problem with connecting methods howerver, and neither Zack nor I know how to fix it. Hiro might know how to fix it, but he is busy at the moment so I will wait to ask him. Zack did a little research, and found how to fix it so the placed walls turn red now when the mouse enters the destruction area.
