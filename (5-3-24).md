I checked one more time if anyone had player changes so I could make the new animations, and no one did. Once I started working on them, Zack came over to see what they looked like since he hadn't seen them yet. He gave me a few tips on what to set the FPS and frame durations to on the animated sprite so it makes them look more smooth and fluid. He also showed me how to randomize the idle animations without having to use an enumerator. For some reason though, it got rid of all of the animations, so I had to remake them, and now they don't work properly. For some reason, if you are walking in some direction, the player will just stick on the last frame of the animation instead of transitioning to the idle animation, and it only prints the value of the random chance to play a certain idle when the player is moving. I turned all of the looping off in the walking animations, but that didn't change anything. I found that it only makes the player stick to the last frame of the walking animation it was playing after at least 2 chance values have been printed. I found that I was leaving a gap in between the values when one animation would play as compared to the other. Once I took this gap out, the player no longer stuck to the last frame of the animation, but it still only prints the chance value when the player is moving. The new animations that I made got overwritten for a second time, but I found out why. The old animations were saved as a resource so it was just automatically loading the resource of the old animations and getting rid of the new ones. I got rid of the old resources and replaced them with new ones for the new animations so they won't get deleted anymore.
