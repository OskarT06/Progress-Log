Zack wants me to add an area to decide whether the placeable can be placed or not. I started adding it in one way, but Zack wanted it sets up differently so he changed it and then found some bugs that he also fixed. He pulled from my branch once everything he got working, and said that he wants Hiro to make a build so there isn't really any point in me adding anything new since Hiro won't be able to get any of it. Also because if he pulls from my branch after I make something that doesn't work fully, it could interfere with the build's functionality. Aiden made an updated version of the campfire sprite sheet, so I went in and re-did the campfire animation.
