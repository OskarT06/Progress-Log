I asked Zack what he wants me working on, and he suggested that I go back to the bear trap I started working on a while ago but stopped because base building was more important. I am not sure if it will work the same as it did before though because I made it before Hiro reorganized the files and renamed others. There are a few problems with the scene. I had to add a navigation layer to get the enemy to work, I had to change the z-index on the tile map, I had to connect new signals from the nodes, I had to take the code under the old functions and change it over to the new ones, and I have to figure out why the enemy is playing the attacking animation when it gets stuck in the trap once. I showed Zack what was going on, and he told me to use a different method than what I was using which made some of the code I had irrelevant. Once I changed to the new method, Zack added some code to make it so that the enemy breaks out of the trap based on how many animations it plays, and not when a timer runs out. He also changed one of the animations I had to the broken frame so that after the enemy breaks out, the trap has to be repaired before it can be set off again.
