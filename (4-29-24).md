After looking through the files and attempting to incorporate sound effects, we found that a lot of ours need to be re-done so that there isn't such a big gap in between when the stream player starts playing and when the actual sound effect that was made plays. I don't really have anything to add to the game, so I started working on my post mortem. I had my uncle play the game, and asked him what he had trouble with so I could notify my team members of what we could fix. The only complaints were that the music should change differently between biomes, and that the ponds in the marsh were hard to identify since they just look like gray colored parts of earth.
