Zack made a campfire scene that he wants me to use when I make the other buildables placeable. I started to set up a scene and the first code I put in was that if 0 is pressed, it will print that it was, but for some reason, it won't print that 0 was pressed and there aren't any pre-requisites that it hasn't met yet. I showed Zack and he added a new input into the input map, and changed the function which worked. I know just have to figure out how to instance the campfire scene and make it placeable. I got the campfire to work correctly, but you can only place one, and I got the bear trap to be instantiated and placeable, but it doesn't place where the mouse is. I discarded the code that Zack added by accident because it came up in github as a UID change, so I showed him, and he was able to recreate his old code, so placing the bear trap and campfire work now. He also fixed a bug making it so that the game crashes if an enemy walks into the bear trap in any scene other than the bear trap test scene.
