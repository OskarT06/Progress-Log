I went back to making the buildables placeable like I did with the base parts. I had to merge from Zack's github branch so I could get the campfire since he wants me to do the same thing with it that I did with the bear trap. I was running into an issue where when I changed what part I should have been able to see, it was still just staying the bear trap even when I changed it. I found that I had to reference one of my functions that defines each of the placeables under the ready function. This solved my problem so I was able to see how the other items were lining up with the tile map. I changed the offsets for the other items so they all line up with the tile map in the way the looks the most normal. I showed Zack and he said that one of the placeables was getting a new sprite, and one of the was a base module so I don't have to worry about making it placeable yet. He also said that I need to make the cooking pot line up the same as the campfire since a cooking pot can only be placed over a campfire. I am trying to figure out how I can make it so that when an input is pressed, the buildable selected changes, similar to how the base parts rotate, but it isn't working. Aiden made a new animation for an obelisk to put in the game, which I said I could animate since what Ian is working is close to being done, and I could get the animations done fairly quickly. I showed Aiden the obelisk animations, and he said what I should change the fps to in order to make the animations look right.
