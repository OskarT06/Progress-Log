I am trying to figure out how to make it so that you can't fix the bear trap from anywhere, you have to actually click on the bear trap to be able to fix it. I can probably borrow some of the code from the script for picking up items so that there is a specific area that you have to be inside of before you can actually repair it. I got it so that when you are within a certain range of the bear trap, you can right click to repair it, but you can still click anywhere to repair it. I also found a small bug where even if the bear trap had not been repaired yet, it would still play the animation of it breaking when the enemy went through it's area. I fixed this by just simply saying that if the area is exited and the animation is not sprung, then it will play the breaking animaiton. I found something else making it so that if the enemy is in the area when the bear trap is reset because right click was pressed, the enemy doesn't get caught in it. This doesn't seem like a very big problem because it is fairly hard to do, but it still could cause someone to use materials to fix the trap but it doesn't do anything, resulting in a waste of what they used. I showed Zack what was happening, and he knew a solution to the problem that I had. He then told me that he wants me to make a scene similar to the wall placing scene, just with the buildables instead. I copy and pasted the code from the base_part scene into my new one and changed it accordingly, but for some reason, it doesn't work the same as the base_part scene. I showed Zack, and he added a few things to help make it easier to tell what is going on. I made code to make it so that when you left click, the trap stops following the mouse, but it didn't work so I am going to have to keep working at it, though once I get it working, it should be easy to make it for the other buildables.
