I made some more decent progress on the godot best practices, but there are still a few sections that I have to finish reading. I helped around where I could, and we started trying to think of things we can add for the endgame. We started thinking of titles and settled on one Joe's Automaton. I am not sure why we chose Joe's Automaton, but we might still be able ot change it later if we think of a better one.
