Ian looked back over the sound effects that we have made and put into the game's files, and consulted with Zack to see which ones he wants us to remake. Once he found out which ones we need to make or remake, he told Davian, Aiden, and I so we could start thinking about how we would make them. We need to redo to eating, drinking, and walking, and make the hand emerging, the hand submerging, and walking in water. Once we finished making the sound effects that we could think of, I came back to start working on the new player animations that Aiden made. Before I can make the animations however, I have to wait until no one is working on the player since the new player animations have more frames and animations than the older one and I don't want any changes to be discarded so no one has to redo anything. I asked if anyone is working on the player and Zack said that he might have some changes but he isn't sure. He said that I shouldn't merge from his branch though because he hasn't pushed everything and there are weird bugs happening to something.
