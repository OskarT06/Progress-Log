Since Hiro and I finished the base building and destroying stystem, I started just playing the build of the game to find bugs to try to identify them so we could fix them before the end of school. I found that the knife is not craftable for some reason even though the axe is. I just doesn't come up in the drop cloth menu after the blueprint and correct materials are collected. A lot of the other blueprints require shadow goop which you can only get from killing a shadow monster, which you can only do with the gun or knife. I started looking through different video game death screens to see if there were any that we could adapt into our death screen. Most of the ones I found just said game over which we already have, and most of the other ones that could have fit were too long to fit on the screen.
