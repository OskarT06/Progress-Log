Zack wants me to take other buildables and make them their own scenes so I can instance them into the test scene I made. The flower pot is making a little bit of trouble since when I place it, it doesn't appear, almost like it is behind or under something. I showed Zack what was going wrong, and he couldn't find what was happening until we found out that there were 2 flower pot scenes for some reason, and it was trying to load a scene with nothing in it instead of the correct one. I had to remake the scene because once we deleted the incorrect, blank scene, the correct one vanished. The script was still existant however so I just had to replace the nodes and reload the script. This made it so that flower pot wouldn't set the animation frame to 0 by default when you are placing it because it thought that the numbers of the animation frames were integers and not just frame numbers. All I had to do was change the onready variable to an export variable, assign the animated sprite, and then it worked. The snap offset was a little weird, but that was a very simple fix since the offset and interval were already set up. I found a few bugs where you can select an infinite amount of one item if you continue to press 0, and it places them all at once. I also found that when there are a certain amount of light points on the screen at a time, it will hide some of them if there are too many. This shouldn't be a problem because I don't think anyone will be placing hundreds of campfires on top of each other.
