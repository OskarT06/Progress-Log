Now that Aiden is here, Zack was able to tell him what he wants changed about the new player animations. Aiden went to try to get them done according to how Zack wanted them, and once he finishes, I can redo the animations that Zack wanted to be changed. I asked if there was anything else that we had to get finished besides saving, and Zack suggested that I animate the Thomas enemy and then try and get the other enemies working so we can have more variation other than the basic shadow enemy. Zack said that I should just be able to copy and paste the script from the basic enemy into a new script for the wolf and adjust certain things so it fits the wolf's requirements. Aiden finished reamking the player walking animations so I swapped back over to the player scene to remake the walking left and right animations. I changed back over to the wolf scene once I was done with the player animations to finish making the wolf's collision shapes and connecting signals. Once I finished this, I pushed it to branch and told Zack so he could test it since he had more experience in getting the enemies to work the way he wants them. Zack started adding and changing things on the wolf, and told me to do the same ting I did for the wolf but for the snake.
