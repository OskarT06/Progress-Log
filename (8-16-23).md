(8/16/23): I met the poeple in the class and got to know them a little bit better to figure out which poeple I would be able to work the best with. This helped later down the line when I already know some of the people in the group I joined and I already knew that I could work with them. Learning names helped when I needed to ask them more in depth quesitons, but it also gave me a chance to connect with them and begin establishing a bond.
