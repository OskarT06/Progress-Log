I have to figure out how to make it so that the building menu re-opens when placing a green wall, but doesn't when trying to place a red wall. I am really just trying a bunch of different ways that I think of to attempt to make it work, and if I can't get it to work, I can ask Hiro if he has any ideas. I showed Zack how the building system is right now and he said that it's fine that the building menud doesn't come back up when you place a green wall so I know just have to figure out how to prevent resources for a wall being used when you cancel placing a wall. I asked Hiro how he has the resource consumption set up, and he added a couple variables and sorted some existing lines of code under a new function so the resources are now only used when the wall is placed. The building system is now done unless something new has to be added or if something has to be changed. Hiro said that I should make a build to test how the building system works before merging it into the core branch. He's running me through the process, but it checking to see if he can get his export presets and transfer them over to me. I tried to test the building in the build of the game I made, but until we get tool crafting working, I won't be able to. I found a couple of issues with the build, but they're bugs that have already been noticed so I don't need to bring them up again.
