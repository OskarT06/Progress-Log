I set up the computer I would be working on. This was the first time I have ever done anthing like that which showed me that I have the ability to solve problems and do things I have never done before by just trying and figuring it out as I go. Once my computer was fully set up, I started downloading and setting up accounts on the apps that I would need such as xcode, unreal engine, discord, blender, github, and taiga.
